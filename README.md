Raffle Entry processing

- Process CSV, find all the emails
- ???  Check the address ??? Kick them out if they're not in CA?
- For each email, look up on shopify
- If they exist, push a custom object into the queue
- If they don't, create a new customer and then push the resulting object into the queue
- ??? What to do about addresses? ??
- Once we've collected all the emails in the queue, then start processing them and creating a draft order for each
- Output to a CSV?



End result

```javascript
const variantId = 123456789

  // ...
